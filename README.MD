# Disk Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer
A streamlit powered web app to visualize commonly used disk scheduling algorithms

This web app aims to provide an easy and beginner friendly interface to visualize and understand
some common **disk scheduling** algorithms used internally by Operating Systems

## Why build this?

Operating Systems is an important topic commonly taught to Sophomore CS undergrads. While
teachers do an excellent job at explaining the algorithms, there is something special about a cool
animation to visualize them. Unfortunately if you search for Disk Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer, there are hardly any useful beginner friendly sites

So I thought, "Why not build it myself?" 

There you have it, a simple yet powerful web app that can graph the path taken while servicing requests by different algorithms as well as compare the performance of various algorithms
